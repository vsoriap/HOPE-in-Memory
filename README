#HOPE-in-Memory
This repo contains a Hirschberg algorithm implementation in OpenMP that is Efficient in Memory

To compile the different source codes use the make files with the two possible variants hirchberg and hirchberg_omp

To launch the experiments use SLURM with the submit.sh files

To compare the output use diff against the reference output inside data. The different versions are named short.out, medium.out, large.out, double_large.out and quadra_large.out
